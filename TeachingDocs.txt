Sate is basically a data that a comonent that hold overtime, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle. It is the coponents's memory. Give examples
Note that updating the state riggers react tp re-render the component

State allows developers to :
a. Update the component's view by re-rendering it
b. Persist local variables between renders

Steps to creating a state in react:
1. Always import useState from react
Create a state variable using the usestate keyword. 
2. Use the state variable in the code in the jsx.
3. Update the piece of state in event handler. 


The usestate function always return two thins: the value you gave it, and the function that will be used to  update the component view. 
That's why we aslso we have those two things:
const [step setStep] = useState(1)

. make the buttons next and previuos work
. handle the bug using conditional statement


any react kwyword starting with use like usestate,usereducer is called a hook. and we can only use hooks at the top level of the component function.
